# MooreMachineSimulator
This solution allows for the creation of Moore Machines with defined outputs and state transitions. Moore Machines can be simulated with various inputs and their outputs can be read at each state.

# Features to Add
Currently, I need to add reading Moore Machine definitions from JSON, and conversion from Mealy Machines to Moore Machines.
